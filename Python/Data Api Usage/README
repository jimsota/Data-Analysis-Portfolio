🔗 Cryptocurrency API Usage & Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to consume a REST API, collect live data, and perform data analysis and visualization using Python. The notebook fetches cryptocurrency market data from the CoinMarketCap API, processes the JSON response into a structured format, and analyzes price and percentage changes over time.

The project highlights practical skills in API integration, data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization.
