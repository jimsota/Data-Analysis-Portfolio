📌 Project Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
on global population data using Python. 
The goal is to analyze population distribution, 
trends, and relationships across countries and continents 
by applying data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques.

The project demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, 
numerical analysis, correlation analysis, and d
ata visualization, making it suitable for 
  data analyst and research-focused roles.
