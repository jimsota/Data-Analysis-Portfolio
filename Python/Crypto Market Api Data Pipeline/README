🔗 Cryptocurrency Market Intelligence Data Pipeline
Analytical Context

Financial and market intelligence systems rely on accurate, 
time-stamped data collected at scale. Cryptocurrency markets, in particular,
require structured pipelines that can ingest rapidly changing data 
while respecting API constraints and data integrity requirements.

*Problem Statement*

Manual or poorly structured API calls lead to:

Inconsistent datasets

Missing timestamps

Rate-limit violations

Poor reproducibility

These issues reduce analytical reliability and decision confidence.

Solution Overview

This project implements a secure, reproducible data collection pipeline using the CoinMarketCap API. The pipeline normalizes raw market data into structured tables and appends timestamps to enable time-series analysis and downstream reporting.

Methodology

Secure API authentication using environment variables

Exception handling for network and API errors

JSON normalization into relational format

Timestamped data collection

Rate-aware request execution

Outputs

Clean, structured cryptocurrency market dataset

Time-series-ready records

Foundation for dashboards, alerts, or forecasting

Why This Matters

This project demonstrates the ability to:

Design analytical data pipelines

Work with real-world APIs responsibly

Prepare market data for decision-making use cases

That tone = professional analyst, not student.
