📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, standardizing, and preparing customer
contact data for analysis or operational use. 
Using Python and Pandas, the notebook transforms a
raw customer call list into a clean, structured,
and reliable dataset by addressing common data quality 
issues found in real-world business data.

The project demonstrates essential data preprocessing skills
required for data analysis, CRM systems,
and reporting workflows.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python 3

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset

The dataset is an Excel file containing customer contact records, including:

First and last names

Phone numbers

Address information

Do-Not-Contact indicators

Additional administrative columns
🔍 Data Cleaning & Transformation Steps

The notebook performs the following operations:

Removing duplicate customer records

Dropping irrelevant or unused columns

Cleaning last name fields by removing unwanted characters

Standardizing phone numbers:

Removing non-numeric characters

Formatting phone numbers consistently

Splitting address data into:

Street Address

State

Zip Code

Standardizing categorical values (e.g., No → N)
Handling missing and invalid values

Removing customers marked as Do Not Contact

Removing records without valid phone numbers

Resetting and reindexing the final dataset

📈 Final Output

The resulting dataset:

Contains only valid, contactable customers

Uses consistent formatting across all columns

Is ready for analysis, reporting, or customer outreach systems
🎯 Learning Outcomes

Real-world data cleaning techniques

String manipulation and data standardization

Handling missing, invalid, and restricted records

Preparing datasets for business or analytical use

🚀 Possible Improvements

Use relative file paths for portability
