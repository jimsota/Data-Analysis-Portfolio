📊 Data Aggregation Project with Pandas
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform data aggregation and exploratory analysis 
using Python and Pandas. The notebook focuses on grouping, summarizing, 
and analyzing structured data to extract meaningful insights from a dataset.

The project uses common aggregation techniques such as groupby, mean, sum, count, 
and descriptive statistics, making it suitable for beginners and intermediate learners in data analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python 3

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset
The project works with a CSV dataset (Flavors.csv) containing variables such as:

Base Flavor

Flavor Rating

Texture Rating

Liked (Yes/No)

⚠️ Note: The dataset path in the notebook is local. Update the file path when running the project on another system.

🔍 Key Operations Performed
Loading CSV data using Pandas

Grouping data by one and multiple columns

Calculating:

Mean

Sum

Count

Maximum values

Applying .agg() for multiple aggregations

Using .describe() for detailed statistical summaries

Display customization for better readability

📈 Sample Analysis Tasks
Average flavor and texture ratings by base flavor

Comparison of ratings based on customer preference (Liked vs Not Liked)

Summary statistics for grouped data


🎯 Learning Outcomes
Practical use of Pandas groupby and aggregation functions

Improved understanding of data summarization

Hands-on experience with exploratory data analysis (EDA)
