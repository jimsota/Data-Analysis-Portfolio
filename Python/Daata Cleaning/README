🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing with Pandas
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing raw customer data using Python and Pandas. The notebook demonstrates how to transform messy, inconsistent data into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset.

The project covers common real-world data issues such as duplicates, inconsistent formatting, missing values, and invalid records.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python 3

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from an Excel file containing customer call records, including:

Names

Phone numbers

Address information

Do-Not-Contact flags

⚠️ File paths in the notebook are local. Update the path when running the project on another system.

🔍 Data Cleaning Steps Performed

Removing duplicate records

Dropping irrelevant columns

Cleaning string values (removing unwanted characters from names)

Standardizing phone number formats

Splitting address fields into:

Street Address

State

Zip Code

Handling missing and invalid values

Standardizing categorical values (e.g., Yes/No → Y/N)

Removing records marked as Do Not Contact

Removing rows with missing phone numbers

Resetting and reindexing the cleaned dataset

📈 Result

The final output is a clean customer contact dataset that:

Contains no duplicate or invalid entries

Has standardized formats across all columns

Is suitable for downstream analysis or CRM use

🎯 Learning Outcomes
