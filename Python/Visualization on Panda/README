📊 Data Visualization with Pandas
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create insightful visualizations using Pandas’ built-in plotting capabilities. The focus is on transforming raw data into meaningful visual insights that support data-driven decision-making.

The project showcases practical skills in data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization, emphasizing clarity, accuracy, and reproducibility rather than flashy graphics.
